//! The window host: the game's display shown through `render` (wgpu on Vulkan), paced to the
//! PS1's field rate, with the keyboard and gamepads as the pad. SDL3 keeps the window, input and
//! sound.
//!
//! Keys (physical positions, so other layouts work): arrows = D-pad, Z = Cross, X = Circle,
//! A = Square, S = Triangle, Enter = Start, right Shift = Select, Q/W = L1/R1, 1/2 = L2/R2.
//! Gamepads use SDL's standard layout (south = Cross, east = Circle, west = Square,
//! north = Triangle), the D-pad or left stick for directions, the triggers for L2/R2.
//! Closing the window exits 0. `DW1_WINDOW_LOG=1` logs frames presented and the
//! display size (first frame, on size changes, then every 60 frames).
//!
//! Picture settings (`settings.rs`, kept between runs; a note in the corner says what changed
//! and whether it's original or an addition): F2 render scale (auto, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8), F3 no
//! wobble, F4 fit (integer, the original look, or fill), F5 full colour, F10 widescreen (16:9,
//! an addition; needs render scale 2x+), F11 or Super-Ctrl-F fullscreen. F12 writes a bug
//! snapshot (`snapshot.rs`). The `Fit` used at 16:9 is picked here from the picture's size, so
//! a 4:3 picture (a movie, or scale 1) is never stretched.
//!
//! Before the game starts, `Window::splash` shows a short text screen (about 2.8 s; any key,
//! button or click skips it) saying this is the native Linux build. `DW1_NO_SPLASH=1` skips it;
//! `DW1_SPLASH_SHOT=<file.png>` saves it as a picture. Headless and replay runs never show it.
