//! Overlay data lifetimes (run side; the build side is `overlays.rs` next to `build.rs`, which

//! zero-initialised and uninitialised data in a second; [`snapshot`] copies every first section
//! before the game starts, and `dw1_overlay_reset`, which the game's `loadDynamicLibrary` calls
//! under `DW1_NATIVE`, puts an overlay's copy back and zeroes its second section as the PS1's
//! load of its file would, keeping the variables the PS1 had in the resident executable or in
//! its overlay `.bss`.
