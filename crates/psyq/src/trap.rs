//! Trapping stubs for SDK calls that aren't implemented yet.

//! The game C links against every SDK function it calls from the start (Phase 1); the ones
//! nobody has written yet stop the program with their name instead of doing something
//! plausible. A stub takes no arguments: in the host ABI the caller's arguments sit unread in
//! registers, and nothing returns, so the C prototype doesn't matter.
